# Readable By Joe Kerns

This repo is the code for Project #2 of Udacity's React Nanodegree program. It was created using [create-react-app]( https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md ).

## How to run this repo

Clone and run the server by following the instructions here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

Next, clone this repo.

Then

* `npm install` or `yarn install`
* `npm start` or `yarn start`

### I learned quite a bit through this process.

Once I have the next project complete, I will spend some time on ES6. I feel like I have the concepts of React and Redux fairly well under control but I fight with the syntax needed to turn my logic into clean, concise, error free code.
